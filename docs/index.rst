pyrtools
====================================

|pypi-shield| |conda-shield| |license-shield| |python-version-shield| |build| |binder| |doi|

Pyrtools is a python package for multi-scale image processing, adapted
from Eero Simoncelli's `matlabPyrTools
<https://github.com/LabForComputationalVision/matlabPyrTools/>`_.

The tools include:
  - Recursive multi-scale image decompositions (pyramids), including
    Laplacian pyramids, QMFs, Wavelets, and steerable pyramids.  These
    operate on 1D or 2D signals of arbitrary dimension.
  - Fast 2D convolution routines, with subsampling and boundary-handling.
  - Fast point-operations, histograms, histogram-matching.
  - Fast synthetic image generation: sine gratings, zone plates, fractals, etc.
  - Display routines for images and pyramids.  These include several
    auto-scaling options, rounding to integer zoom factors to avoid
    resampling artifacts, and useful labeling (dimensions and gray-range).

**NOTE**: If you are only interested in the complex steerable pyramid, we have a pytorch implementation in the `plenoptic <https://plenoptic.readthedocs.io/en/>`_ package; the implementation in plenoptic is differentiable.

Pyramid resources
------------------

If you would like to learn more about pyramids and why they're helpful
for image processing, here are some resources to get you started:

 - Brian Wandell's `Foundations of Vision
   <https://foundationsofvision.stanford.edu/chapter-8-multiresolution-image-representations/>`_,
   chapter 8 (the rest of the book is helpful if you want to
   understand the basics of the visual system).

   processing". <http://persci.mit.edu/pub_pdfs/RCA84.pdf>`_
