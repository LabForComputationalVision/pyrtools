class Pyramid:
    """Base class for multiscale pyramids

    You should not instantiate this base class, it is instead inherited by the other classes found
    in this module.

    Parameters
    ----------
    image : `array_like`
        1d or 2d image upon which to construct to the pyramid.
    edge_type : {'circular', 'reflect1', 'reflect2', 'repeat', 'zero', 'extend', 'dont-compute'}
        Specifies how to handle edges. Options are:

        * `'circular'` - circular convolution
        * `'reflect1'` - reflect about the edge pixels
        * `'reflect2'` - reflect, doubling the edge pixels
        * `'repeat'` - repeat the edge pixels
        * `'zero'` - assume values of zero outside image boundary
        * `'extend'` - reflect and invert
        * `'dont-compute'` - zero output when filter overhangs imput boundaries.

    Attributes
    ----------
    image : `array_like`
        The input image used to construct the pyramid.
    image_size : `tuple`
        The size of the input image.
    pyr_type : `str` or `None`
        Human-readable string specifying the type of pyramid. For base class, is None.
    edge_type : `str`
        Specifies how edges were handled.
    pyr_coeffs : `dict`
        Dictionary containing the coefficients of the pyramid. Keys are `(level, band)` tuples and
        values are 1d or 2d numpy arrays (same number of dimensions as the input image)
    pyr_size : `dict`
        Dictionary containing the sizes of the pyramid coefficients. Keys are `(level, band)`
        tuples and values are tuples.
    is_complex : `bool`
        Whether the coefficients are complex- or real-valued. Only `SteerablePyramidFreq` can have
        a value of True, all others must be False.

        The user should not call this directly. This is called during construction of a pyramid,

        filters) and the input image, as well as the `extra_height` parameter (which corresponds to
        the residuals, which the Gaussian pyramid contains and others do not).

        ----------

            The pyramid will have this number of scales unless that's greater than the maximum
            possible height.
        extra_height : `int`, optional
            The automatically calculated maximum number of scales is based on the size of the input
            image and filter size. The Gaussian pyramid also contains the final residuals and so we
