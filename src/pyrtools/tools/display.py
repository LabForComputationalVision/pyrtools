    If you do want to use, do the following: fig = plt.figure(FigureClass=PyrFigure) (NOT fig =
    PyrFigure()) and analogously for other pyplot functions (plt.subplots, etc)

    this enables us to make sure there's no aliasing: a single value in the (image) array that
    we're plotting will be represented as an integer multiple of pixels in the displayed figure

    The dpi that's chosen is an arbitrary value, the only thing that matters is that we use the
    same one when creating and saving the figure, which is what we ensure here. This also means
    that you will be unable to use plt.tight_layout, since we set the spacing and size of the
    subplots very intentionally.

        The output formats available depend on the backend being used.

        Arguments
        ----------

        fname : str or file-like object
            A string containing a path to a filename, or a Python
            file-like object, or possibly some backend-dependent object
            such as :class:`~matplotlib.backends.backend_pdf.PdfPages`.

            If *format* is *None* and *fname* is a string, the output
            format is deduced from the extension of the filename. If
            the filename has no extension, the value of the rc parameter
            ``savefig.format`` is used.

            If *fname* is not a string, remember to specify *format* to
            ensure that the correct backend is used.

        Other Arguments
        ----------------

        dpi_multiple : [ scalar integer > 0 ]
            How to scale the figure's dots per inch (must be an integer to
            prevent aliasing). Default is 1, equivalent to using to the value
            of the figure (default matplotlib savefig behavior with dpi='figure')

        facecolor : color spec or None, optional
            the facecolor of the figure; if None, defaults to savefig.facecolor

        edgecolor : color spec or None, optional
            the edgecolor of the figure; if None, defaults to savefig.edgecolor

        orientation : {'landscape', 'portrait'}
            not supported on all backends; currently only on postscript output

        papertype : str
            One of 'letter', 'legal', 'executive', 'ledger', 'a0' through
            'a10', 'b0' through 'b10'. Only supported for postscript
            output.

        format : str
            One of the file extensions supported by the active
            backend.  Most backends support png, pdf, ps, eps and svg.

        transparent : bool
            If *True*, the axes patches will all be transparent; the
            figure patch will also be transparent unless facecolor
            and/or edgecolor are specified via kwargs.
            This is useful, for example, for displaying
            a plot on top of a colored background on a web page.  The
            transparency of these patches will be restored to their
            original values upon exit of this function.

        frameon : bool
            If *True*, the figure patch will be colored, if *False*, the
            figure background will be transparent.  If not provided, the
            rcParam 'savefig.frameon' will be used.

        bbox_inches : str or `~matplotlib.transforms.Bbox`, optional
            Bbox in inches. Only the given portion of the figure is
            saved. If 'tight', try to figure out the tight bbox of
            the figure. If None, use savefig.bbox

        pad_inches : scalar, optional
            Amount of padding around the figure when bbox_inches is
            'tight'. If None, use savefig.pad_inches

        bbox_extra_artists : list of `~matplotlib.artist.Artist`, optional
            A list of extra artists that will be considered when the
            tight bbox is calculated.

    image : `np.array` or `list`
        the image(s) to plot. Images can be either grayscale, in which case

        must be 3d arrays of shape `(h,w,c)` where `c` is 3 (for RGB) or 4 (to
        also plot the alpha channel). If multiple images, must be a list of
        such arrays (note this means we do not support an array of shape
        `(n,h,w)` for multiple grayscale images). all images will be
        automatically rescaled so they're displayed at the same size. thus,
        their sizes must be scalar multiples of each other.
    vrange : `tuple` or `str`
        If a 2-tuple, specifies the image values vmin/vmax that are mapped to

                     value, and come from the minimum or maximum across all
                     images, whichever has the larger absolute value
        * `'auto/auto1'`: all images have same vmin/vmax, which are the
                          minimum/maximum values across all images
        * `'auto2'`: all images have same vmin/vmax, which are the mean (across

        * `'auto3'`: all images have same vmin/vmax, chosen so as to map the
                     10th/90th percentile values to the 10th/90th percentile of
                     the display intensity range. For example: vmin is the 10th
                     percentile image value minus 1/8 times the difference
                     between the 90th and 10th percentile
        * `'indep0'`: each image has an independent vmin/vmax, which have the
                      same absolute value, which comes from either their
                      minimum or maximum value, whichever has the larger

        image.
    title : `str`, `list`, or None, optional
        Title for the plot. In addition to the specified title, we add a
        subtitle giving the plotted range and dimensionality (with zoom)

        * if `str`, will put the same title on every plot.

          assigning each title to corresponding image.

          unsupported for complex tensors).
